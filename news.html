        <b>Will school start in August in 2020?</b> (12/18/19)  By: <a href="/user1.html">dhhsnews</a>
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Recently, it has been speculated that school will start before labor day in 2020.
        <br>
        While this is unconfirmed, it would make scene. This would allow the school year to start earlier and posibly have a longer summer in 2021.
        <br>
        This would be the first time the school year has started in August in over two years. If this is true, the school year start about six days earlier than last year.
