        <b>Will A Supernova be Seen From Earth in The Near Future?</b> (1/9/20)
        By: <a href="/user2.html">Drwillpill</a>
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Scientists are predicting a strange phenomenon that might happen soon.
        It is called a "Supernova" and it is the result of when a star explodes,
        or "dies."
        <br />
        This is what it could look like:
        <br />
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/e61ee36e-8da4-4ebd-b34f-a00896ce2fe8%2Fthumbnails%2F1supernova.jpg?1578603877456"
          height="250"
          width="250"
          alt="Supernova"
        />
        <br />
        This looks harmful, but it will only harm anything if it is within a
        radius of 30 light years.
        <br />
        (It could wipe out an entire species if it was within 30 light years.)
        <br />
        The one that is predicted to explode is further away.

        <br />
        Speaking of which, the one predicted to explode is named Betelgeuse.
        This is what it would look like in real time.

        The last supernova was on Oct. 9, 1604, so we would be extraordinarily
        lucky to see this in our lifetime.
        <br />
        Don't get your hopes up, however, because this has a one in a million
        chance of happening. On the contrary, Betelgeuse does have some
        significant reasons to explode.
        <br />
        It is dimming, and scientists believe that will cause it to explode.
        Most are super thrilled as well, indicating some high chances of a
        supernova.
        <br />
        Thank you for reading this, and I hope we all get this chance of a
        lifetime. It would last for a couple of years.

        interesting to look for.

        <b>3 hour delays?</b> (1/8/20) By: <a href="/user1.html">dhhsnews</a>
      </h3>
      <h4>
        If you've checked your email recently, you may have noticed a new
        message from Madison Public Schools. This is some of the first text in
        the email:
        <br />
        <i
          >With a few months of winter left to go, I wanted to share with the
          community a new delayed start option the district is adding to its
          repertoire: a three-hour delay.

        <a
          href="https://cdn.glitch.com/e61ee36e-8da4-4ebd-b34f-a00896ce2fe8%2FScreenshot%202020-01-08%20at%2012.43.37%20PM.png?v=1578505427291"

            src="https://cdn.glitch.com/e61ee36e-8da4-4ebd-b34f-a00896ce2fe8%2FScreenshot%202020-01-08%20at%2012.43.37%20PM.png?v=1578505427291"

            width="500"
        /></a>
        <br />
        The message goes on to talk about how school days could be saved by
        using this new method.
        <br />
        What this may mean is a change to the snow day system. Before this,
        school would have been canceled in December, with 2 inches on the
        ground.
        <br />
        Instead of a day off, we might have a three hour delay replace it. This
        would create a longer summer and more vacation (yay!). However,
        <br />
        there may be a few issues to the new delay. Normally, the school day at
        Daniel Hand goes from 7:25AM to 2:00PM; a 6 hour and 35 minute long
        school day.
        <br />
        Assuming every class is approximatly cut in half by the delay, that
        would only leave classes at about 30 minutes long. It may be difficult
        to be productive and
        <br />
        achieve a large ammount of work in that time. Meanwhile, some may argue
        that some time at school is better than no time at school. Besides,
        whats wrong with a longer summer?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Will school start in August in 2020?</b> (12/18/19) By:
        <a href="/user1.html">dhhsnews</a>
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Recently, it has been speculated that school will start before labor day
        in 2020.
        <br />
        While this is unconfirmed, it would make sense. This would allow the
        school year to start earlier and posibly have a longer summer in 2021.
        <br />
        This would be the first time the school year has started in August in
        over two years. If this is true, the school year start about six days
        earlier than last year.
