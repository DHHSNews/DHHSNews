        <b>3 hour delays?</b> (1/8/20)  By: <a href="/user1.html">dhhsnews</a>
      </h3>
      <h4>
        If you've checked your email recently you may have noticed a new message from Madison Public Schools. This is some of the first text in the email:
        <br>
        <i>With a few months of winter left to go, I wanted to share with the community a new delayed start option the district is adding to its repertoire: a three-hour delay. 

</i>
        <br>
        <a href="https://cdn.glitch.com/e61ee36e-8da4-4ebd-b34f-a00896ce2fe8%2FScreenshot%202020-01-08%20at%2012.43.37%20PM.png?v=1578505427291" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/e61ee36e-8da4-4ebd-b34f-a00896ce2fe8%2FScreenshot%202020-01-08%20at%2012.43.37%20PM.png?v=1578505427291" height="300" width="500" /></a>
        <br>
        The message goes on to talk about how school days could have saved from using this new meathod.
        <br>
        What this may mean is a change to the snow day system. Before this, school would have been canceled in December with 2 inches on the ground.
        <br>
        Istead of a day off, a three hour delay may replace the day off. This would create a longer summer and more vacation (yay!). However,
        <br>
        there may be a few issues to the new delay. Normally, the school day at Daniel Hand goes from 7:25AM to 2:00PM creating a 6 hours and 35 minutes school day.
        <br>
        Assuming every class is approximatly in half by the delay, that would only leave classes at about 30 minutes. It may be difficult to be productive and
        <br>
        achive a large ammount of work in that time. Meanwhile, some may argue that some time at school is better than no time at school. Besides, whats wrong with extra summer?

        <b>Will school start in August in 2020?</b> (12/18/19)  By: <a href="/user1.html">dhhsnews</a>
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Recently, it has been speculated that school will start before labor day in 2020.
        <br>
        While this is unconfirmed, it would make sense. This would allow the school year to start earlier and posibly have a longer summer in 2021.
        <br>
        This would be the first time the school year has started in August in over two years. If this is true, the school year start about six days earlier than last year.
