      <h4>
        <div class="news">
          Have you ever been surfing the web at school and gotten this screen ?
          You have encountered the web filter, also known as
          <a href="https://securly.com">Securly</a>, the software Madison Public
          Schools uses to keep students safe from inappropriate content on the
          internet. However this may come at a cost to students. Upon reading
          the
          <a href="https://securly.com/privacy">Securly, Inc. privacy policy</a
          >, we can find out how exactly data from what is called the “services”
          (software and other Securly products) is being shared. According to
          how we share your information section, they will share information
          with third parties to “perform functions on our behalf including
          helping us provide you with the Services”. They will also contribute
          data to a legal case, if requested such as in a subpoena. They will
          also share non-identifiable information with third parties for
          advertising, research and marketing. Overall, we give Securly a B for
          privacy.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now let's talk about Google. Most people, if not all, use Google as
          their search engine of choice and may even use their products such as
          Docs, Sheets, Calendar, and many more. Google search receives around
          3.5 billion searches per day, or about 1.2 trillion searches per year.
          Since Google offers many different products, they have to store the
          data these projects receive on servers. This data may be the text you
          put in a Google Doc or the images you have on Google Photos. These
          servers cost money for Google to maintain and protect
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZmGGAbHqa0">(literally)</a>.
          If all of their products are free, how do they make money? Google uses
          targeted ads, and they use this data from the searches and data that
          you give Google. So how does Google share or use your personal
          information exactly? Before we reveal the answer, we must tell you
          that Google’s data collection is not limited to it’s website
          (google.com).
          <a href="https://donttrack.us"
            >Google trackers are on 75% of websites</a
          >, so data collection can happen on almost any website. After reading
          through a briefed edition of Google’s Terms of Service, Google can
          sell your personal data (medical, racial, ethnic, political, religious
          or sexuality), however you can
          <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">opt out</a> of
          hyper-specific info being shared. Unfortunately you can’t opt out of
          all of Google’s tracking. Your searches and data in google will be
          used for advertising and can also be used in subpoena. When using
          Google your device type and unique device identifiers are collected.
          This data is also kept forever. We give Google a F for privacy.
          <br />
          <br />
          In conclusion, be thoughtful about what you do online as everything
          can (and often will) be used for advertising (and maybe even against
          you in the case of a subpoena). Your data may be shared with third
          parties as we saw with Securly, however, it is often more dangerous
          when being used by a company like Google and not being shared. A few
          tools you can use to protect your privacy are the Firefox and Brave
          browsers that block many trackers and DuckDuckGo, a browser that does
          not track searches and personal information. To protect yourself at
          school, <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/schools-are-spying-students-students-can-fight-back">this is a good article to read</a>.

        We recently interviewed a few students at Daniel Hand on Instagram.
        <br />
        The questions were:
        <br />
        Question 1: Have you seen bullying at dhhs this year?
        <br />
        Question 1 results: The people who we talked to said that they had seen
        no bullying, expept for one who said they saw a small bit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Question 2: Have you bullied this year?
        <br />
        Question 2 results: Nobody that we interviewed had bullied this year.
        <br />
        <br />
        Question 3: On average, how much homework do you recieve per night?
        <br />
        Question 3 results: On average, about 35 minutes each night.
        <br />
        <br />
        Question 4: Any comments on the school?
        <br />
        Question 4 results: They all had some comments. Here are the best:
        <br />
        <br />
        Question 4 comment 1: "Tax fraud should be legal and sport other than
        basketball and football should recive more funding from the school."
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Question 4 comment 2: "Other than a pretty early start, Hand had many
        opportunities for many students interested in many different things."

        <b>Will A Supernova be Seen From Earth in The Near Future?</b> (1/9/20)
        By: <a href="/user2.html">Drwillpill</a>
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Scientists are predicting a strange phenomenon that might happen soon.
        It is called a "Supernova" and it is the result of when a star explodes,
        or "dies."
        <br />
        This is what it could look like:
        <br />
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/e61ee36e-8da4-4ebd-b34f-a00896ce2fe8%2Fthumbnails%2F1supernova.jpg?1578603877456"
          height="250"
          width="250"
          alt="Supernova"
        />
        <br />
        This looks harmful, but it will only harm anything if it is within a
        radius of 30 light years.
        <br />
        (It could wipe out an entire species if it was within 30 light years.)
        <br />
        The one that is predicted to explode is further away.

        <br />
        Speaking of which, the one predicted to explode is named Betelgeuse.
        This is what it would look like in real time.

        The last supernova was on Oct. 9, 1604, so we would be extraordinarily
        lucky to see this in our lifetime.
        <br />
        Don't get your hopes up, however, because this has a one in a million
        chance of happening. On the contrary, Betelgeuse does have some
        significant reasons to explode.
        <br />
        It is dimming, and scientists believe that will cause it to explode.
        Most are super thrilled as well, indicating some high chances of a
        supernova.
        <br />
        Thank you for reading this, and I hope we all get this chance of a
        lifetime. It would last for a couple of years.

        <b>3 hour delays?</b> (1/8/20) By: <a href="/user1.html">dhhsnews</a>
      </h3>
      <h4>
        If you've checked your email recently, you may have noticed a new
        message from Madison Public Schools. This is some of the first text in
        the email:
        <br />
        <i
          >With a few months of winter left to go, I wanted to share with the
          community a new delayed start option the district is adding to its
          repertoire: a three-hour delay.

        <a
          href="https://cdn.glitch.com/e61ee36e-8da4-4ebd-b34f-a00896ce2fe8%2FScreenshot%202020-01-08%20at%2012.43.37%20PM.png?v=1578505427291"

            height="300"
            width="500"
        /></a>
        <br />
        The message goes on to talk about how school days could be saved by
        using this new method.
        <br />
        What this may mean is a change to the snow day system. Before this,
        school would have been canceled in December, with 2 inches on the
        ground.
        <br />
        Instead of a day off, we might have a three hour delay replace it. This
        would create a longer summer and more vacation (yay!). However,
        <br />
        there may be a few issues to the new delay. Normally, the school day at
        Daniel Hand goes from 7:25AM to 2:00PM; a 6 hour and 35 minute long
        school day.
        <br />
        Assuming every class is approximatly cut in half by the delay, that
        would only leave classes at about 30 minutes long. It may be difficult
        to be productive and
        <br />
        achieve a large ammount of work in that time. Meanwhile, some may argue
        that some time at school is better than no time at school. Besides,
        what's wrong with a longer summer?
        <br />
        <br />

      <h4>
        Recently, it has been speculated that school will start before labor day
        in 2020.
        <br />
        While this is unconfirmed, it would make sense. This would allow the
        school year to start earlier and posibly have a longer summer in 2021.
        <br />
        This would be the first time the school year has started in August in
        over two years. If this is true, the school year would start about six
        days earlier than last year.
