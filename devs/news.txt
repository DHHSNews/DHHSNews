        <br />
        Question 1 results: The people who we talked to said that they had seen
        no bullying, expept for one who said they saw a small bit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Question 2: Have you bullied this year?
        <br />
        Question 2 results: Nobody that we interviewed had bullied this year.
        <br />
        <br />
        Question 3: On average, how much homework do you recieve per night?
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        Question 4: Any comments on the school?

        Question 4 comment 1: "Tax fraud should be legal and sport other than
        basketball and football should recive more funding from the school."

        <br />
        <br />
        Question 4 comment 2: "Other than a pretty early start, Hand had many
