Bag.el
Bægle
ba·gel /ˈbāɡəl/ A dense bread roll in the shape of a ring, made by boiling dough and then baking it.

The Definiton of a bagel. From Wikipedia
A bagel (Yiddish: בײגל‎ beygl; Polish: bajgiel), also historically spelled beigel,[1] is a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland. It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, that is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy or sesame seeds. Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.[2][3] Bagels are eaten toasted or untoasted.
