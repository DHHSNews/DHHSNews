Dear developers and writers of DHHS news,

BEFORE EDITING PLEASE READ THIS:

If you are adding a story or user account, you can add it here.

If you are editing the style of the website or CSS, please try it first on our test server (testserver-dhhsnews.glitch.me)

If you are very confident in your site update with CSS, please edit that in the main CSS file (style.css)

Add all changes to the change log!!! (devs/changelog.txt)

Also: Avoid baggel.txt. I highly recommend that you do not visit that page.
